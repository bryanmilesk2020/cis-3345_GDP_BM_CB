## Credential Theft

## Summary
The logs show traffic from a machine infected with malware communicating with a malicious server. 
The malware repeatedly checks in with a C2 server, exfiltrates email data, pretends to interact with Microsoft webmail endpoints, 
likely steals credentials, and may send phishing messages through the victim's account.
