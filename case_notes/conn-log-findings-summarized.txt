Tools: kali linux, zeek

Objective: Identify attacker's IP address and attack methodology

Findings:

1) 1,640 connections on port 6667, standard port for IRC, a protocol commonly used by botnets to establish a C2 communication path.
676 connetions to port 65500, paired with an external IP, 212.117.171.138 suggests a dedicated custom C2 channel. Possible C2 activity.

2) 13,204 connections with port 25 and 140 connections with port 587. Both ports are used to for email. A high volume of email traffic
suggests spam, phishing, and/or exfiltrating data. Malicious SMTP activity.

3) SMB/NTLM/DCE_RPC have 124-133 connections and are used for Windows Network Sharing. They also have vulnerabilities and malware may
try to exploit those vulnerabilities to expand the botnet. Possible worm propagation.

4) 4,821 connections with port 53 and 4,891 count for DNS service. Extremely high volume of DNS requests to a local DNS server 
(147.32.80.9) suggests rapid Domain resolution with DGA used by Conficker to find its current C2 server

5) 64,162 connections to 184.173.217.40 on port 443 (HTTPS) could be core C2 communication using encrypted traffic to blend in with
other, legitimate traffic. Suggests C2 activity

6) Longst live connections (94.63.149.150:80 & 212.117.171.138:65500) could be persistent link for recieiving commands/sending data,
paired with the suspicious 65500 port, suggests C2 activity.


Conclusion:
A single compromised host (147.32.84.165) heavily engaged in COnficker-style botnet activity.
