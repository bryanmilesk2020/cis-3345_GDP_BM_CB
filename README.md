1. Project Overview

This repository documents the network forensics investigation into the compromise of an internal host (147.32.84.165) that was utilized as a node in a sophisticated, multi-stage Command and Control (C2) botnet operation.

The analysis focuses on identifying malicious communication patterns, confirming malware delivery, and mapping the entire kill chain from initial infection to interactive remote control by the threat actor.

2. Key Findings
   
The investigation confirms a full compromise by Conficker-style Trojan malware, culminating in sustained RDP-based control.
